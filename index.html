				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The purpose of the Research Progress Review is to assess the progress of higher degree research (HDR) candidates and ensure they are on track to complete their degree in a timely manner. It provides an opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Affirm the candidate's progress if satisfactory.</li>
  <li>Develop a research plan and set new milestones for the next review period.</li>
  <li>Review the research and supervision arrangements with an independent panel.</li>
  <li>Offer a safe environment for the candidate to raise any issues impacting their progress.</li>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
<p>The types of reviews in the UNSW Research Progress Review process are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Annual Research Progress Review</strong>: Conducted yearly to assess the candidate's progress and ensure they are on track.</li>
  <li><strong>Confirmation Review</strong>: Required for PhD candidates within the first year (FTE) to confirm they have a feasible research plan and have met all necessary milestones.</li>
  <li><strong>Overtime Review</strong>: For candidates who exceed the maximum time for their degree. Progress is reviewed every 3 months to ensure the research is nearing completion.</li>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
<p>Confirmation of Candidature is a formal process required for all PhD candidates, typically scheduled around 0.75 FTE from the start date of the
term in which the candidate commenced, and no later than 1 year FTE. EFTSL. The purpose is to confirm that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The candidate has developed a feasible and detailed research program suitable for a doctoral degree.</li>
  <li>The candidate has demonstrated the capacity to undertake research at the doctoral level.</li>
  <li>All mandatory milestones, such as a literature review, research proposal, and any required training, have been completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful confirmation is essential for the candidate to continue their PhD program. Where confirmation of candidature cannot be completed within 1.25 FTE, the candidate may be
asked to <a href="#showcause">Show Cause</a>.</p>

<p>All full-time and part-time HDR candidates must have their research progress reviewed by an independent panel at least once per calendar year of enrolment</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will receive an email about the upcoming review.</li>
  <li>You and your supervisor will need to complete the form on <a href="https://gris.unsw.edu.au/">GRIS</a></li>
  <li>For the first review, the school will arrange at least two panel members for you.</li>
  <li>The school will schedule a review meeting.</li>
  <li>You must attend the review on time. A candidate will be asked to <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/showcauseguideline.pdf">Show Cause</a> if they do not attend a scheduled research progress review.</li>

<p>The role of milestones in the research process is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help manage progress by breaking down the research plan into short, medium, and long-term goals.</li>
  <li>Provide a clear framework for tracking progress and identifying areas that need attention.</li>
  <li>Allow both the candidate and supervisors to regularly assess how much progress has been made and adjust timelines or strategies if needed.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the candidate stays on track for timely completion of their research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Milestones are reviewed and updated at each Research Progress Review to reflect the candidate’s progress and set achievable goals for the next review period.</p>

<p>Candidates are requested to Show Cause in a letter from the Dean of Graduate Research. The candidate is asked to provide a formal written response which is assessed by the relevant Faculty Higher Degree Committee (the ‘Committee’).
The Committee makes a recommendation to the Dean of Graduate Research as to whether the candidature should be discontinued, or whether the candidate should be given an opportunity to complete their candidature under strict conditions.
The Dean of Graduate Research makes the final decision regarding the outcome of the case.
