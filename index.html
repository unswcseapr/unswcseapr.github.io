                  <li>Affirm the candidate's progress if satisfactory.</li>
                  <li>Develop a research plan and set new milestones for the next review period.</li>

                <p>Candidates must apply for overtime enrolment when candidates in their final term of on-time candidature may not be on track to submit on time.

                <p>An overtime review is conducted when a research candidate exceeds the maximum allowable time for their degree.
